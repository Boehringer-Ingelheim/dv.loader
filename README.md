## Basic usage

**Note**: `dv.loader` is only designed to be used with `.RDS` and `.sas7bdat` file formats.

```r
# getting data from a network file storage folder
dv.loader::load_data(sub_dir = "subdir1/subdir2", file_names = c("adsl", "adae"))
```

```r
# getting data locally (e.g., if you have file `./data/adsl.RDS`)
dv.loader::load_data(sub_dir = "data", file_names = c("adsl"), use_wd = T)
```
